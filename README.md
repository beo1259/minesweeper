## minesweeper

currently missing timer, flag count, and solver toggle (if you want to use solver, you'll need to uncomment the 'analyzeBoard' lines in main.ts). Solver is not complete and crashes on largers states. Beware.

## running locally

**from root repository directory...**

in 1 terminal window (if you plan to make code changes):

1. `npm install --save-dev typescript`

2. `tsc --watch`

in separate terminal window:

3. `npx serve` - runs on port 3000 by default
